								<h4>Hello, my name is Ben - pleasure to meet you.</h4>
								<p>
									From my humble beginnings of not knowing anything about software development in 2018, I've written 
									countless lines of code that have created beautiful, prosperous software for companies, friends/family, 
									and myself. I've become quite confident in my ability to construct products using knowledge I already have, 
									learning new technologies to create dynamic solutions, and gradually polishing my skills one project at a time.

									As a fan, I like to watch the NBA (CLE/LAL/PHX), the NFL (CLE/NO), NCAAF/NCAAB(tOSU/WSU), 
									the PBA (bowling), the PGA (golfing - especially Tiger Woods!), and horse racing.
								</p>

									</li>
								</ul>

								<!-- Coding -->
								<h4 class="major">Coding</h4>
								<p>Ever since I began to code, I usually combine my hobbies with something I have learned in class or from YouTube to create something interesting for myself.</p>
								Things I have attempted:
								<ul>
									<li>NCAAF stats that determine championships and/or better records - python</li>
									<li>NBA stats that determine playoff contending teams - python and tableau</li>
									<li>Horse racing predictive modeling - google colab (python), excel, and tableau</li>
									<li>Roullete betting strategies - python and excel</li>
									<li>Stock information/stats that determine pricing patterns - excel and python</li>
									<li>Personal website from scratch - html, css, django</li>
									<li>shell scripts to automate processes - bash</li>
									<li>Dummy NBA game - python</li>
									<li>Simple guessing games or simple GUIs - python and java</li>
									<li>Created a simple API system - Java (Spring Boot)</li>
									<li>I even bought a Macbook for a few months to check out how different coding is vs a Windows machine</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Check out my GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/BenjamP3" class="icon brands fa-github"><span class="label">GitHub</span></a></p>
								
								<!-- Gaming -->
								<h4 class="major">Gaming</h4>
								<p>
									I grew up with an Xbox 360, and I still use it to this day. I've also used the Xbox One, but I have migrated to the "PC Master Race" recently. 
									I built my own PC a few years ago and have a semi-beefy graphics card (3060 TI FE).
								</p>
								Games I play:
								<ul>
									<li>Xbox Games: NCAA Football series, Assassin's Creed series, Call of Duty series</li>
									<li>PC Games: Fortnite, Valorant, Fortnite, Far Cry series, Assassin's Creed series</li>
								</ul>

								<!-- YouTube -->
								<h4 class="major">YouTube/Emerging Tech</h4>
								<p>
									I use YouTube as a resource - I tend to watch videos about AWS technologies and other languages like Go, Swift, Rust, Kotlin, PHP.
									Also, I use YouTube to learn about emerging technologies - a good portion is about new hardware from Apple/Google/Samsung. IMO, it is smart
									to stay up to date with what technology is coming out to consumers to better prepare yourself to make smart purchases or be aware of market opportunities
									(potential investments).
